# ColorDetectionAR
Immersive Media Programming AR Team Project

1. Concepts
   - Scanning colors from real life with the camera (Color Mining)
   - Placing 3D-models in real life using plane detection (Coloring Somthing)

2. Main Components
   - Adventure: For mining color, you have to explore the environment.
   - Creativity: High creativity is needed in the coloring process.
   - Storyline: The user becomes a person of the Nocolor Land.

3. Key Features for Developint
   - Detection: Need to detect the color of the real world through the camera.
   - UI/UX: Have to make intuitive and conceptual UI for user experience.
   - Interaction: Need to create natural, variable interactions in AR environments.
  
4. Challenges
   (1) Collecting color part: In the mission, some colors are assigned to players
      - Players find the colors in real world, then scan them in specific order.
      - When players scan the assigned color in right order(color mining), they get points!
        
   (2) Placing 3D model part: To accomplish other mission, players should complete and place 3D models in real world.
      - 3D models can be completed by filling the colors they collected(color restoring).
      - Some 3D models have restrictions, such as minimum number of colors.
